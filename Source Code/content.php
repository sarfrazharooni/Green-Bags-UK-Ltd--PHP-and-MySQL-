		      <h2> Company Background and History </h2> 
		      <p> The Green Bag Company is a new company which has recently been set 
			  up in Sunderland to provide cheap, reusable carrier bags which customers
			  can take to the supermarket and use again and again, thus reducing the amount
			  of waste plastic thrown away. </p>
			  
			  <p> 
			    The company has decided that the Web may be suitable vehicle for the sale
				for its products. The company has a variety of different bags for sale and before
				venturing fully into Web based operation they would like to commission a prototype
				system which will demonstrate if the Web is in fact a capable sales platform.
